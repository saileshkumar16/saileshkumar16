## Projects
- **Intelligent Weather Monitoring – STM32F407VGT6**  
  Built a basic weather logger using LM35 and RTC. Configured UART, I2C, and LCD via STM32 HAL, and wrote custom drivers for peripheral integration.  

- **ARMv8-A Exception Levels Simulation with QEMU**  
  Simulated ARMv8-A boot sequence (EL3→EL2→EL1→EL0) on QEMU Cortex-A72. Implemented startup code, linker script, UART driver, and assembly routines to manage EL transitions. Verified privilege level drops using CurrentEL prints and GDB.  

- **IoT Crop Protection System**  
  Developed a Raspberry Pi-based intrusion detection system with YOLOv8, trained on 3000+ images. Integrated Blynk IoT for real-time alerts. **Patent Published: 202541034995**.
